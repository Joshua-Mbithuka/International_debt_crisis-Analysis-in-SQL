# International_debt_crisis-Analysis-in-SQL
On this project I will investigate international debt data collected by The World Bank. a global organization that funds countries to manage their economies. I will seek to answer specific questions such as:
* The number of countries with debt
* The country with the highest debt and the amount of its debt
* The average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators
* The most common debt indicator
